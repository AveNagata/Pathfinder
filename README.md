# Created using React App

This project was bootstrapped with React.

## Usage

The project will continually be updated as I implement more algorithms.
Currently you can single click to select the start/end points and single click again to place them in a different position.
You can click and drag to toggle walls on/off.

There is a known bug in this version that causes a crash if you deselect the walls on the border of a generated maze.

## Algorithms
Pathfinding: Dijkstra's
Maze Generation: Prim's
