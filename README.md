# A pathfinding project inspired by Clément Mihailescu
This project was created using React/JSX and was inspired by Youtuber Clément Mihailescu. No code was copied from his video. I was curious if I was able to recreate his project. So far the project has been successful.

## Usage

The project will continually be updated as I implement more algorithms.
Currently you can single click to select the start/end points and single click again to place them in a different position.
You can click and drag to toggle walls on/off.

There is a known bug in this version that causes a crash if you deselect the walls on the border of a generated maze.

## Algorithms
Pathfinding: Dijkstra's
Maze Generation: Prim's
